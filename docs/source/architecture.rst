Architecture
------------

This package consists of several modules and applications.

The first frontier will be a set of command-line tools which takes a set of
files (with exact number and type depending on the
`file-format <fileformats.html>`_) and prepares an event-file.

This will be implemented for various file-formats, e.g.
`.xdf <fileformats.html#xdf>`_, `.mat <fileformats.html#mat>`_, or
`.cnt <fileformats.html#cnt>`_.
